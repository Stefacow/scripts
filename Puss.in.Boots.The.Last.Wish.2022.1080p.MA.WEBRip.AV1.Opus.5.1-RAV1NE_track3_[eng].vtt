00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:21.081
PUSS:
Star light, star bright,

2
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.084
first star I see tonight,

3
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.587
I wish I may, I wish I might

4
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.466
have this wish I wish tonight.

5
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.974
Once upon a time,

6
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.852
a Wishing Star
fell from the sky.

7
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.066
Scorching a great woods black.

8
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.404
The Dark Forest was born,

9
00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:55.240
the Wishing Star hidden
at its center,

10
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.285
filling it with new life,

11
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:02.914
and the legend of a single wish
locked away in the star,

12
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.168
waiting to be granted.

13
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.345
CROWD:
Puss in Boots!

14
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.431
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

15
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.142
-Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

16
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.270
-Welcome to my fiesta!

17
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.565
Make yourselves at home, yeah.

18
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.941
Come on, eat.

19
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.235
Drink up.

20
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:35.113
Hey! Hola, amigo.

21
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.240
Good to see you again.

22
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.995
Papa, he stepped on my face!

23
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.247
And we will never wash it again.

24
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.128
People of Cordova...

25
00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.755
It's Del Mar.

26
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.174
-People of Del Mar...

27
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.261
...accept this golden gift
from Puss in Boots.

28
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.764
-Play a song!

29
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.391
No, no, no. I couldn't.

30
00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.267
-Sing, Puss, sing!

31
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.311
Nah, I couldn't possibly...

32
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.907
!Ay, ay, ay, ay!

33
00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.957
Yeah!

34
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.965
My clothes.

35
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.800
My wig.

36
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.720
My portrait!

37
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.099
Oh.

38
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.059
:
Hey, Governor.

39
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.936
Uh, one second.

40
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.321
The outlaw, Puss in Boots.

41
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.410
Welcome! Mi casa es su casa.

42
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.288
No, su casa es mi casa.

43
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.624
-Arrest these filthy peasants

44
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:54.252
and bring me the head
of Puss in Boots!

45
00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.962
Hey! This is a party!

46
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.589
Where is the music?

47
00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.400
Puss in Boots has never
been touched by a blade.

48
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.569
-But you?

49
00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.325
-Skin that cat!

50
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.536
Governor, lighten up.

51
00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.725
-Uh-oh.

52
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:54.145
Silly guards,
dogpiles don't work on cats.

53
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:01.361
Holy frijoles.

54
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.363
You awoke the sleeping giant
of Del Mar!

55
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.376
BOY:
Giddyap!

56
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.504
Whee! I'm flying!

57
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.798
No, you are not flying.

58
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.466
I will save you!

59
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.218
Save me, too!

60
00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.053
If it's convenient.

61
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.139
-You, launch me.

62
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.058
And the rest of you,
play double time.

63
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.036
-Spanish Splinter.

64
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.921
PUSS:
Gracias.

65
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.428
Fear me, if you dare.

66
00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.613
Yee-haw!

67
00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.875
-Yeah!

68
00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.594
Hey, giant!

69
00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.638
Pray for mercy from...

70
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.224
Puss in Boots!

71
00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.563
Hey, you want to see
something cool?

72
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.419
Gracias, Del Mar.

73
00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:23.670
You have been great!

74
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.422
-Get home safely.

75
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.507
-Good night.
-Puss in Boots!

76
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.301
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!
Puss in Boots...

77
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.928
You're still here?

78
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.931
Okay, okay.

79
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.224
One more number.

80
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.519
I call this one
"The Legend Will Never Die..."

81
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.274
BOY:
Puss in Boots!

82
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.196
MAN:
Puss? Puss.

83
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.573
Puss in Boots.

84
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.664
Uh, where am I?

85
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.041
Not to worry.
You're in good hands.

86
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.501
My hands!

87
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.712
I am the village doctor.

88
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.464
I am also the village barber,
veterinarian,

89
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.174
dentist and witchfinder.

90
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.720
And in my professional opinion,
you need a wash,

91
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.222
a blowout and a little trim
around the hindquarters.

92
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.557
Uh...

93
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.225
That's my professional
barber opinion.

94
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.561
But, putting on my doctor's hat,

95
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.230
I think we need to run
a few tests.

96
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.483
All right. Reflexes.

97
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.443
-Catlike.

98
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.069
-Temperature.

99
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.405
-Now lift your tail and relax.

100
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.992
Trust me, I run hot. Yep.

101
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.745
Then how about the latest
in modern medical technology?

102
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.371
-Leeches!

103
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.373
To draw out the evil humors.

104
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.376
Suit yourself. More for me.

105
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.003
Uh, listen, Doctor.

106
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.298
Thanks for everything, you know,
but I am feeling great.

107
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.926
Strong, like a bull! You know?

108
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.262
Now, do you know a good place
to get some gazpacho?

109
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.097
Please. This is serious.

110
00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.390
What is it?

111
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.268
Puss in Boots,
how do I say this?

112
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.231
You died.

113
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.235
Doctor, please.

114
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.779
Relax! I am Puss in Boots.

115
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.781
I laugh at death.

116
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.283
You see?

117
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.118
And anyway, I am a cat.

118
00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.912
I have nine lives.

119
00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.289
And how many times
have you died already?

120
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.042
Uh... I don't know.

121
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.168
I never counted.

122
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.379
I am not really a math guy,
you know?

123
00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.589
-Gato.
-Take it easy, Doctor.

124
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.800
Let's see, uh...

125
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.386
There was the running
of the bulls in Pamplona.

126
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.640
:
Hola, señorita.

127
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.642
-Do you like gazpacho?

128
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.397
Guess it's not
your night, huh, fellas?

129
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.901
:
I am telling you,

130
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.153
a cat always lands on his feet.

131
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.655
Watch.

132
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.287
No. Puss in Boots
doesn't need a spotter.

133
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.330
Watch.

134
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.500
No need to pull into port.

135
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.502
This will revolutionize travel.

136
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.920
Watch.

137
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.258
Uh, excuse me.
Does this have shellfish in it?

138
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.509
Yes, sir.

139
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.719
Eh.

140
00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:21.681
Puss, I think you set
the oven too high.

141
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.183
I am a master of the baking.
Watch.

142
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.438
And then there was
the giant today.

143
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.942
So, what is that?
Like, uh, uh, four?

144
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.028
That makes eight, Puss.

145
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.863
You are down to your last life.

146
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.782
My prescription:
no more adventures for you.

147
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.492
You need to retire.

148
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:43.244
Me? Retire?

149
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.163
Are you
the village comedian as well?

150
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.166
Puss, is there any safe place
you can go?

151
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.418
Any special someone
you can rely on

152
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.253
in this moment of need?

153
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.507
I am Puss in Boots,
loved by one and all.

154
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.009
Anyone in particular?

155
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:02.305
I mean, uh,
how could I possibly choose?

156
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.890
Mm-hmm.

157
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.934
This is the address
of Mama Luna.

158
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.894
She is a cat fancier,

159
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.729
always on the lookout
for a new lap cat.

160
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.814
-You will be safe there.
-Lap cat?

161
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.733
I am no lap cat, Doctor.

162
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.235
I am Puss in Boots!

163
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.695
Not anymore.

164
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:18.821
Barber's orders.

165
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.907
I mean, doctor's orders.

166
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:25.745
And remember, Puss,
death comes for us all.

167
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.205
Treat?

168
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.291
You've really got to work
on your bedside manner.

169
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.430
I am Puss in Boots.

170
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.432
I am no one's lap cat.

171
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.436
That doctor is a quack
and a crazy man.

172
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.021
He should stick to cutting hair.

173
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.940
-Last call, Señor Boots.

174
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.275
Another glass of cream.
Make it your heaviest.

175
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.445
Oh, I keep the heavy stuff
in the back.

176
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.660
"Retire."

177
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.371
You are too good-looking
to retire.

178
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.010
Well, well.

179
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.762
If it isn't
Puss in Boots himself.

180
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.266
In the flesh.

181
00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:31.060
Uh, hey.

182
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.814
There's the famous hat,
the feather

183
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.651
and, of course, the boots.

184
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.737
My compliments to your cobbler.

185
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.990
Thanks.

186
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.243
Uh, good to meet you, too.

187
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:53.166
Hey. I never do this,
but can I get your autograph?

188
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:57.170
Been following you
for a long time.

189
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.173
Sign right there.

190
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.512
Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death,

191
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.389
bounty hunter.

192
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.266
So I've heard.

193
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.478
You will find your reward
does not come easily.

194
00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.064
This I tell you.

195
00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.901
Everyone thinks they'll be
the one to defeat me,

196
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.361
but no one's escaped me yet.

197
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.863
All right.

198
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.573
-Let's get it over with.

199
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.867
Fear me, if you da...

200
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:37.335
Okay, no more messing around.

201
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.716
-Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

202
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.941
You're not
living up to the legend, gato.

203
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:37.103
I just love the smell of fear.

204
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.783
What's the matter?

205
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.619
Lives flashing before your eyes?

206
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.290
Pick it up.

207
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.459
Pick it up.

208
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.528
Corre, corre, gatito.

209
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.006
I am no longer worthy.

210
00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.216
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.018
We are gathered here today

212
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.730
to say goodbye to Puss in Boots.

213
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.359
There are no words
to express such a loss.

214
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.112
Thank you.

215
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.660
But it would be a crime
not to try.

216
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.579
He was known across the land
by many names.

217
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.956
The Stabby Tabby.

218
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.749
El Macho Gato.

219
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.626
The Leche Whisperer.

220
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:07.586
To some, an outlaw.

221
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.630
To more, a hero.

222
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.925
To all, a legend.

223
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.760
I was right.

224
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.096
Words were not enough.

225
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.767
But perhaps a song.

226
00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.066
:

227
00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.848
I told you
health department people,

228
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.266
there are no cats here!

229
00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.185
Uh...

230
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.520
-Meow?

231
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.691
-Oh!

232
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.152
You're not from
the health department, are you?

233
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.154
No, you're not.
We better get you inside

234
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.741
because, baby,
they are always watching.

235
00:19:18.741 --> 00:19:22.495
I am Mama Luna,
and this is my home.

236
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.288
And now it's your home, too.

237
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.916
Your forever home.

238
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.085
Ow!

239
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.841
I bet you never even had a name.

240
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:39.428
But you know what, I have
thought of something perfect.

241
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:41.472
I shall call you...

242
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.849
-...Pickles!

243
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.518
Brother cats, sister kitties,

244
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.021
meet your new roommate.

245
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.648
Say hello, Pickles.

246
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.526
Meow, eh?

247
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.529
Ooh.

248
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.906
What? Did I say something salty?

249
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.866
It's my second language.

250
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.119
Stupid mittens.

251
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.037
Get off me.

252
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.713
-Oh, no.

253
00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.221
This is a person potty, Pickles.

254
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.472
That's your potty.

255
00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.644
So this is where dignity
goes to die.

256
00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.486
No, no way.

257
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.492
-Uh-uh-uh.

258
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.256
-Meow.

259
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.965
You got the scent?

260
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.888
These are too small,

261
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:49.808
and these are too big.

262
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.478
But these ones...

263
00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:55.397
these ones are just right.

264
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:03.280
Baby! Track that cat.

265
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.257
Do you mind?

266
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.008
I'm trying to eat here.

267
00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.095
I mean, meow. Whatever.

268
00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:27.721
Oh, sorry.

269
00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:31.559
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
You're a talking cat?

270
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.227
I'm a talking cat.

271
00:22:33.227 --> 00:22:35.062
Let's talk.

272
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.523
I'd rather eat.

273
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.191
Oh, not a problem.

274
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.193
We can eat and talk
at the same time.

275
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.861
-No hablo inglés.

276
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.572
¿Hablas español? !Yo también!

277
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.740
!Ah! ¿De dónde eres?
¿Te gustan las siestas?

278
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.201
-I don't speak Spanish, either.

279
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.703
You're funny.

280
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.372
-Uh... okay. Good talk.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

281
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.833
Pickles? Is that your name?

282
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.460
Me, I don't have a name
or a home.

283
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:04.049
So, I'm no expert, but you
don't look like a Pickles.

284
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.343
Well, you don't look like a cat.

285
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.387
Okay, okay, okay.

286
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:10.639
Full disclosure: I'm not a cat.

287
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.058
-I'm a dog.
-Hi, Bon Bon.

288
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.560
Meow.

289
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.731
Oh, Pickles has
a new girlfriend? Okay.

290
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.274
I live under the porch.

291
00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.900
It can get a little lonely
down there.

292
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.069
It's mostly controlled by
the rats and the centipedes,

293
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.571
but I have my own little corner.

294
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.072
Congratulations.

295
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.991
I just come up here
for the food and the friends.

296
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.410
-Mostly... mostly the food.

297
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.787
Please don't tell anyone.
I need this.

298
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.998
I won't tell. I don't care.

299
00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:37.499
So you'll keep my secret?

300
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.168
A secret between friends?

301
00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:40.878
Just a secret.

302
00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:43.255
It's funny-- despite all this
best friend bonding,

303
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.257
you're still a mystery to me,
Pickles.

304
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:46.800
What's your story?

305
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.093
My story...

306
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.930
What are we looking at?

307
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:55.267
...is over.

308
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.144
Oh, no.

309
00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:59.188
Want to rub my belly?

310
00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:00.773
Hmm?

311
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:02.399
What-what's happening?

312
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.276
-Rub.
-Hard pass.

313
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.445
Come on, rub.
I need the practice.

314
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.280
I'm gonna be
a therapy dog someday.

315
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.615
What the hell are you
talking about?

316
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:11.075
I'm glad you asked.

317
00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:13.118
When people feel bad,
they can rub my belly.

318
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.287
It'll make 'em feel better.
Rub my belly.

319
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.664
-No. No.
-Come on, rub it.

320
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.290
-Not happening. No.
-Rub it.

321
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.625
Let me be clear.

322
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.461
I don't want to touch
your belly, okay?

323
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.005
Okey doke.
So, what do you want?

324
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:28.550
I want to be left alone.

325
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:51.115
Ugh, you're back.

326
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:53.075
Oh, I never left.

327
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.881
The wolf. He found me.

328
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.477
Hello, missus.

329
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:22.104
We're looking for a cat.

330
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.439
This cat.

331
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.232
We've got an offer for him.

332
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:28.110
What could they possibly want
to offer Puss in Boots?

333
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.029
-What's a Puss in Boots?
-Seriously?

334
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.448
I told you
health department people,

335
00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:33.699
there are no cats here.

336
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:35.868
Make her talk.

337
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.747
Excuse me, my darling.

338
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.207
We're looking for
the legendary Puss in Boots.

339
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.543
Have you perhaps... seen him?

340
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:45.794
Too soft.

341
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.129
Out with it, you old biddy,

342
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:49.298
or I'll have your guts
for garters.

343
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.553
Too hard.
That was not just right.

344
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.638
Oi, Baby, sniff him out.

345
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.557
You don't tell me what to do.

346
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.641
Listen to your sister, Baby.

347
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.268
Oh, she's not my sister!

348
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.811
She's a fugitive orphan.

349
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.313
-Ow!
-She is your sister.

350
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.606
Do as she says.

351
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:09.067
Fine, but all I can smell
is cats' pee.

352
00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.778
-Everybody!

353
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:12.780
Get to the safe room,
just like we practiced!

354
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.656
Oi. She's leggin' it.

355
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.742
Follow me, children! Ow!

356
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.911
Give her the piano
treatment, Papa.

357
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.246
Oh! You think this is
the first time

358
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.123
I've been stuffed in a piano?

359
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.752
-Here we go!

360
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:33.175
-Oh...
-Mama, focus, please.

361
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.641
Hey! There's cats everywhere!

362
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.310
So many cats!

363
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.728
Amateurs.

364
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.689
-I'll be outside.

365
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.608
My cats can play
better than you.

366
00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.612
Goldi, is this him?

367
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.280
GOLDI:
That's a dog in a cat costume.

368
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.824
-Oh, yeah.

369
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.450
Tricky little bugger.

370
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.285
How about this one?
He's a ginger.

371
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.164
Is that a joke?

372
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.292
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones

373
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.961
looks like a legend?

374
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.462
This is definitely not...

375
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.714
BABY:
Puss in Boots! I found him!

376
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.844
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

377
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.971
-Dead? No, no, no, he can't be.

378
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.723
Yep. The nose never lies.

379
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.475
Well, that's that, then.

380
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.143
What say we go
and hibernate, huh?

381
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.478
-No.
-Ow!

382
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.146
The map is being
delivered tonight,

383
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.065
and we have one chance
to steal it.

384
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.359
Without it, we'll never find
the Wishing Star.

385
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:34.194
The Wishing Star.

386
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.863
It does exist.

387
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:38.156
That star has one wish to grant.

388
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.533
One wish?

389
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.577
Think of what
that could mean for us.

390
00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:43.787
Nine lives. Yes!

391
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.664
Well, I don't see
why we needed to hire

392
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.249
Puss in Boots
in the first place.

393
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:51.253
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.

394
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.213
No! Not Jack Horner.

395
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.425
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.

396
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.759
Thank you, Mama.

397
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.178
Yeah, because I've got a plan.

398
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.598
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.

399
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.059
You've got a plan?

400
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.270
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?

401
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.857
No, you ain't
well-fixed for brains.

402
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:15.611
Robbing Big Jack Horner--
very risky.

403
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:18.697
But that wish could get me
my lives back.

404
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.699
And my life back.

405
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.534
Goodbye, Pickles!

406
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.036
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

407
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:26.163
Perro, start digging.

408
00:28:26.163 --> 00:28:27.831
Okay.

409
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.999
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,

410
00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:31.793
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.

411
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:36.131
No, I don't think he would mind,
because he...

412
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.385
...is me!

413
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.555
Oh. O-Okay.

414
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.432
Oh, yeah. Uh...

415
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.059
Normally, I have a sword.

416
00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.852
It's like a whole thing,
you know?

417
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.771
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

418
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:52.564
Not yet, but I will be.

419
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:53.899
I'll come...

420
00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:55.901
-I'll come with you.
-Sorry, perro.

421
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.654
Puss in Boots walks alone!

422
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:07.955
GUARD:
Open the gates!

423
00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:20.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

424
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.720
Hands off the merchandise.
We got this.

425
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.098
Okay. Just get in and get out.

426
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.642
-Easy peasy.
-Lemon squeezy.

427
00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:30.477
Aah! What are you doing here?

428
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.020
I brought you a sword.

429
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.981
That's not a sword.
That's a stick.

430
00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:36.024
-It's a stick sword.
-Go home.

431
00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:37.776
Well, my home is where
my friends are.

432
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.444
Again, not friends.

433
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.779
-Rub for luck?

434
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.115
I don't need luck for this.

435
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.617
I am a highly skilled
master cat thief.

436
00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.411
Watch.

437
00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:52.290
You got this.

438
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:10.058
Hmm.

439
00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:14.813
I pronounce this batch...
delicious.

440
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:19.526
Ship 'em out.

441
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.696
Mr. Horner.

442
00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:25.115
The Serpent Sisters
got the goods.

443
00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:29.202
Is it? Is it the map
to the Wishing Star?

444
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:31.997
Stop everything.
You two, come with me.

445
00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:33.665
We must get this
to the trophy room.

446
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:37.294
You know, it took a lot
of murdering to get this map.

447
00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:38.670
It all started...

448
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.547
Take it to the trophy room!

449
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.102
-What the...

450
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.980
Wow. Look at all
the magic stuff.

451
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.982
Yes, I collect
enchanted objects,

452
00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:01.068
magical icons,
bobbles and geegaws

453
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.403
and la-di-da and blah-blah-blah.

454
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.364
Check it out.
I'm walking on a magic carpet.

455
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.991
-Sweet.

456
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.951
The shrunken ship
of the Lilliputians.

457
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.996
Shut up!
Are those unicorn horns?

458
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.873
Baby unicorn horns.

459
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.042
Half as heavy, twice as sharp.

460
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.544
-Savage.
-They're trinkets.

461
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.797
They're nothing compared
to the awesome power

462
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:23.256
of the magic Wishing Star.

463
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:25.675
Speaking of which,
make with the box, sister.

464
00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:26.843
JO:
You got it, boss.

465
00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:28.720
Like I was saying,

466
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.555
the amount of murdering we...

467
00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.390
Make with the box!

468
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.394
After so many years
of searching,

469
00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.313
this is my moment.

470
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:42.859
With this wish,
I will finally be

471
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:45.070
the master of all magic.

472
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.030
JO:
Hey, Little Jack.

473
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.283
Excuse me?

474
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.827
-Could you do the thumb thing?
-Shh.

475
00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:53.161
Like in the fairy tale?

476
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.830
It wasn't a fairy tale!

477
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.373
It was only a nursery rhyme.

478
00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:58.917
:
Oh, yeah. The lame one.

479
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.128
Little Jack Horner
sat in the corner

480
00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:03.130
eating a Horner pie...

481
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:11.972
Look! A magic puppet.

482
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:17.686
-Thank you. Thank you.

483
00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:19.062
What's impressive?

484
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:21.439
I've been a boy the whole time.

485
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:26.069
Little Jack Horner
didn't have any magic.

486
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:30.657
He was a pathetic,
buttered baker's boy.

487
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:32.993
Little Jack's dead!

488
00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:34.870
I'm Big Jack Horner.

489
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:38.498
JAN:
Uh, Mr. Big Jack Horner, sir...

490
00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:41.042
-I barely know her.
-What do you mean?

491
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.920
We're sisters, you goof.

492
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.714
We got matching face tattoos.

493
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:49.759
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

494
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.638
-Puss?
-Kitty?

495
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.765
-Puss...
-Kitty!

496
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.397
This is my job.

497
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:05.317
No, this is my job.
I'm double-crossing the bears.

498
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.110
No, I am double-crossing
the bears.

499
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.154
They tried to hire me
earlier today.

500
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.072
Well, they tried to hire me
two weeks ago.

501
00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:13.033
That makes you plan B.

502
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.326
-Aha!

503
00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:16.953
-There it is.
-Whew.

504
00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.580
Now, about your payment.

505
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.667
Hold up. You promised us
our weight in gold.

506
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.085
I did, didn't I?

507
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:26.046
Ever hear of the Midas touch?

508
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:28.590
Ah, cool. Dibs.

509
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.468
Oh, no.
I misjudged the situation.

510
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.638
This is why you don't cross
Jack Horner.

511
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:35.847
What is this?

512
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.349
-Are you a pirate now?
-Shh.

513
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:40.268
It's like a possum crawled
on your face and died.

514
00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:42.562
-Shh!
-Of shame.

515
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.272
Please, mock me quietly.

516
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.149
I hate it. It's disgusting.

517
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.652
Well, I love it.
It's distinguished.

518
00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:00.622
Great plan, Baby. Real catlike.

519
00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.713
Uh, can I go?

520
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.757
Pleasure doing, uh...

521
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.387
-Puss in Boots?
-Goldi. Bears.

522
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:18.056
-Hola, Jack.
-Kitty Softpaws.

523
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:21.434
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.

524
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.937
Please. I was the best thief
you ever hired.

525
00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:25.730
-You robbed me.
-You set me up.

526
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.900
You said you were going
on some spiritual retreat.

527
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.068
Namaste.

528
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.820
And you're supposed to be dead.

529
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.113
I got better?

530
00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:34.406
Ugh. Just give us the map.

531
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.074
-And throw in a dozen pies.
-Eh?

532
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.450
Ooh. Have you got
any savory pies?

533
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.286
-What? N-No.
-Yeah, what flavors you got?

534
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.912
Can we get all of that
in a bag to go?

535
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:44.124
Oh, would you stop talking
about blooming pies? Focus!

536
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:45.917
-Hand over that map,

537
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.836
or I'll punch holes
in the lot of ya.

538
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:52.382
-Oh, bums.
-Look out! It's coming down!

539
00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.928
PUSS:
Ha!

540
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:01.141
I hate talking
fairy tale animals!

541
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.771
-What? Get back here!

542
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.481
The best thief has won.

543
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.150
-Huh?
-You're right.

544
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.193
-She did.

545
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.320
Oh, come on!

546
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.614
There. They're getting away.

547
00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.292
-Ooh.

548
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.586
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

549
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.964
Nice catching up with you, Puss.

550
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.841
Got to go.

551
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.261
Here, kitty, kitty.

552
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.931
Is that a stick? What are you
gonna do with that...

553
00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:44.225
-Ow!
-Ow! Me knuckles!

554
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.811
You shouldn't have
done that, mate.

555
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.441
This idiot.

556
00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.990
Hey, Puss.
I found a sandwich in here.

557
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.158
I think it's tuna fish.

558
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.409
-Drive, perro!
-Okey doke.

559
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.170
Oh, cool.
Another member of the team.

560
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.296
BOTH:
We are not a team.

561
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.839
-Eyes on the road!
-Whoa!

562
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.091
Who is this guy?

563
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:18.093
-I'm Puss's best friend.
-No, he isn't.

564
00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:19.302
And his therapy dog.

565
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:20.804
Definitely not.

566
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:23.181
Finally. You need therapy.

567
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.519
Give me the map. Trust me.

568
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:30.730
Trust you?
Like I did in Santa Coloma?

569
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.981
Really? Santa Coloma?

570
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.192
Sí, Santa Coloma.

571
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.738
-Mine!
-Mine!

572
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.073
-Mine!
-Mine!

573
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.832
Hyah!

574
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.383
Good people,
accept this golden gift

575
00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:00.885
from Puss in Boots!

576
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.358
-Speed up! Go, go, go!

577
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:22.240
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

578
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.076
-Careful with this.

579
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.328
I'll take this and that.

580
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.746
Oh, and these. One of those.

581
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:31.124
And I got to take that.
Yes. Yes.

582
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.252
No. Yes! Oh, yeah!

583
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.090
All of these!

584
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.260
This one is right.

585
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:59.652
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog, too.

586
00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.785
What? This is blank.

587
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.455
We've been ripped off!
Where is the...

588
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.458
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

589
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.294
"The Dark Forest
is deep and far.

590
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.255
Within its bounds,
you'll find the star."

591
00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:21.716
The Dark Forest?

592
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:24.177
No one goes
into the Dark Forest.

593
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:25.887
Or comes out.

594
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:28.556
"A single wish
burns true and bright.

595
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:31.768
This map's the key,
so hold on tight."

596
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.521
Suéltalo.

597
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.689
-You let go.
-A stick?

598
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.150
What happened to your sword?

599
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.443
Got rid of it, you know.

600
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:41.986
Made things too easy.

601
00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.488
I needed a challenge.

602
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.949
Yeah, you looked
pretty challenged back there.

603
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:49.160
There's no way I'm letting you
hold the map.

604
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.371
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map.

605
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:53.665
-I can hold it.

606
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.668
Yeah, right.
What's your deal, anyway?

607
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.503
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

608
00:38:58.503 --> 00:38:59.754
I don't think so.

609
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.548
-I don't believe you.
-That's okay.

610
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.883
As long as you believe
in yourself.

611
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.218
Wha...

612
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:07.428
Is he deranged?

613
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.264
-Yep.
-What's your name?

614
00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:11.432
Oh, I've been called
all kinds of things.

615
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.101
Dog, Bad Dog, Stupid Dog.

616
00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:16.187
Hey You! You There! Get Out!
Leave It! Drop It!

617
00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.481
Big Rat, Small Pig, Rat Face,

618
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:20.066
Butt Nugget, for Brains.

619
00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:21.651
You know, that sort of thing.

620
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:24.362
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

621
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.322
That belonged to me.

622
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.908
-Is he done?
-And you are?

623
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.243
Softpaws.

624
00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:31.744
Kitty Softpaws.

625
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:34.247
Wow. Yeah.
Now, that's a good name.

626
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:35.999
There's music
in a name like that.

627
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.459
Kitty Softpaws.

628
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.379
Nice try. Classic con.

629
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.007
No one's that dumb.
No one's that nice.

630
00:39:44.007 --> 00:39:45.341
I don't trust you.

631
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.552
Me, neither.
He cannot be trusted.

632
00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:50.847
But I trust him
more than I trust you.

633
00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:54.017
Wow.
This trip is going to be fun.

634
00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:30.720
This must be the Dark Forest.

635
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.357
Oh, my God!

636
00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:43.775
It's gone.

637
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:44.942
It's back.

638
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.277
Ay, qué miedo.

639
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:49.113
Nothing to worry about.

640
00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.032
We step through as one.

641
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.116
Ready?

642
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.035
One, two, after you.

643
00:40:54.035 --> 00:40:56.162
Wait, what?

644
00:40:58.206 --> 00:41:00.416
Dog? Still alive?

645
00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:02.126
-Let's go find out.
-Wait!

646
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.136
Um...

647
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:16.307
-Whoa.
-Wow.

648
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:20.853
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

649
00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.980
I wish I had
my quinceañera here.

650
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.150
The Wishing Star is
in here somewhere.

651
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.070
Kitty, may I please see the map?

652
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.488
-No.
-Seriously!

653
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:32.824
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

654
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.867
Nope. Not even for one second.

655
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:39.205
Come on, Kitty.
You've got to trust me.

656
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.709
Wait. Wh-Wh-What's...
What's going on with his eyes?

657
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:45.169
Oh, they're getting bigger.

658
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.547
Oh, Kitty!

659
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:49.674
You got to trust him.
Look at those eyes.

660
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.051
Really? You call that cute?

661
00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:55.430
Oh, look at her!

662
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.349
Those eyes are even bigger
than yours.

663
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.600
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

664
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.687
Wait a second. So poofy!

665
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:05.189
-No. With the paws?

666
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.607
Come on.

667
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:08.526
With the hat?

668
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:11.362
It's all so cute!

669
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.574
Cuteness overload!

670
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:17.535
Can we look at the map now?

671
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.208
KITTY:
"Follow this enchanted chart.

672
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:28.254
It knows your path
and knows your heart."

673
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.299
PUSS:
Is that us?

674
00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.400
It says we must go through
the Valley of Incineration

675
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.277
over Undertaker Ridge,

676
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.029
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

677
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:55.656
-Really?
-Let me take a look.

678
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.671
What?

679
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.757
Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

680
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.717
Mountains of Misery?

681
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.053
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

682
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:19.305
There's something wrong
with this map.

683
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.808
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

684
00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:23.518
It's almost like the forest

685
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:25.812
doesn't want anyone
to make a wish.

686
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:28.689
Well, I don't even have a wish,
but can I try?

687
00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.948
Oh, mine says...

688
00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.741
We skip through
the Pocket Full of Posies.

689
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.034
-What?
-Huh?

690
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:42.286
Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.

691
00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.496
-That sounds fun.
-No fair.

692
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:44.997
Why does he get the good one?

693
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.208
Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions,

694
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.626
and arrive at the star.

695
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.379
Oh, wow! That sounds wonderful.

696
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.339
Oh, but no. This is your quest.

697
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.632
I don't want to impose.

698
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.551
-You hold the map.
-Really?

699
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:57.844
But don't you cross me,

700
00:43:57.844 --> 00:44:00.555
or your name will be
Perro Muerto.

701
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.181
Okey dokey.

702
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.144
Wait. Is that...

703
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.023
It's raining bears. Time to go.

704
00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:13.192
-Oh, I'm tellin' ya,

705
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.735
when we get that wish,

706
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.196
it will make everything
just right for all of us.

707
00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.990
Will it make us rich?

708
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.284
Rich enough to hibernate
all the year round?

709
00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:22.785
The richest.

710
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:24.495
Will we be, like,
big-time thieves?

711
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.664
-The biggest.

712
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.833
Eh, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?

713
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.501
-Yeah.
-I'm going to have one of them.

714
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.587
-Yeah?
-Only mine will be purpler.

715
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:35.256
-Like, twice as purpler.
-The purplest!

716
00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:36.883
:
Nice.

717
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:38.843
Big-time thieves coming through!

718
00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:41.053
-I'll race ya!
-You can't beat me, old man!

719
00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.930
What kind of wish
can do all that, Goldi?

720
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.807
Oh, I can't tell ya.

721
00:44:44.807 --> 00:44:47.643
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.

722
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:49.186
Sorry. Birthday wish rules.

723
00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:52.023
Oh, come on.
Mother-daughter secret?

724
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.691
Mama, just drop it, please.

725
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:55.234
Oh. Oh, okay.

726
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:56.527
Hey, come on.

727
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.529
We've got some cats to catch.

728
00:45:02.617 --> 00:45:04.869
Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?

729
00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:07.204
It means I am not
telling you my wish.

730
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.832
He doesn't want to tell us,
because it's something stupid.

731
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:12.418
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.

732
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:14.045
It's distinguished.

733
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.006
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?

734
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:18.799
Can't tell you.

735
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:20.801
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

736
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:23.095
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like...

737
00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:27.850
You're such a...

738
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:35.232
This must be
the Pocket Full of Posies.

739
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:40.780
Out of the way, demon flower.

740
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.740
It's pruning time!

741
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:52.291
Aw, thank you.

742
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.545
We don't have time for this.

743
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:59.090
Perro, I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.

744
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.802
You know, I think
all you have to do

745
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.553
is stop and smell the roses.

746
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:05.930
Seriously?

747
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.599
This is stupid.

748
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.435
-All I smell is bull...
-Shh.

749
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.687
Watch.

750
00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.316
Don't rush through it.

751
00:46:17.316 --> 00:46:19.944
Take your time
and really appreciate

752
00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:21.612
what's right in front of you.

753
00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:27.118
KITTY:
Ugh. His path is so corny.

754
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.995
-Gracias.
-And cheesy.

755
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:31.247
-And lame.
-And weird, like him.

756
00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:34.041
Yeah. Why are you
so ridiculous, dog?

757
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:35.584
What's your story?

758
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:37.003
My story? Oh.

759
00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:39.755
It's actually
a very funny story.

760
00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:41.173
Back when I was a pup,

761
00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:43.134
me and my littermates lived
with a family.

762
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.470
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

763
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.972
and I was always it.

764
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.224
Pick on the little guy,
am I right?

765
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:53.269
They tried putting me in
a packing crate, a dumpster.

766
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:56.772
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

767
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:59.191
So, one day, they get creative

768
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.403
and they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.

769
00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:06.490
And then throw me in a river.

770
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.160
I gnawed a hole in the sock,

771
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.121
and I swam to the surface.

772
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:14.665
Never found them
or my littermates.

773
00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.500
So I guess I'm still it.

774
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.002
-Wow.

775
00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:21.172
That is the saddest
funny story I've ever heard.

776
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:23.090
Well, joke's on them.

777
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.135
That sock they put me in,
I grew into it.

778
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:29.513
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it.

779
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.806
Win-win.

780
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:32.308
Dude, you didn't win.

781
00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.393
You of all people
should have a wish.

782
00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.812
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.

783
00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:38.439
I got everything
I could wish for.

784
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:41.233
-No magic required.

785
00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:42.526
Hmm?

786
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:53.871
DOG:
Oh, lovely.

787
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.962
Oh, we're getting really close.

788
00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:05.341
I can smell two cats,
a dog and... pie?

789
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:10.221
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.

790
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.764
Hey, he remembers us.

791
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:14.308
Behold, Excali...

792
00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.810
Excali...

793
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.021
Excalibur!

794
00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.898
Yeah, I couldn't get
this rock off of it,

795
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:22.233
but still pretty cool, right?

796
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.734
MAMA:
He's gaining on us!

797
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.402
JACK HORNER:
Okay, little left.

798
00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.904
That's it!

799
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.240
-Go faster!
-Whoa, he's up me back door.

800
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:34.411
:
Goldi!

801
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.755
-Oh, look!

802
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.924
Well, start chopping!

803
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:49.593
On it! You don't
have to tell me twice.

804
00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.930
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this Ficus lyra...

805
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.975
Jerry, no!

806
00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.102
Avenge me, Jack!

807
00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.770
-Die, die, die!

808
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.231
-Nope.

809
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.775
Time to bring out the big guns.

810
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.819
:
Guess I overpacked.

811
00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:08.070
Magic snacks.

812
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.738
Save those for later.

813
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.449
Ha! Pay dirt.

814
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.370
All right, magical locust,
defoliate.

815
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.705
Fly and feast.

816
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.207
Eat those flowers.

817
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.626
I-I'm not a magic locust.

818
00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.670
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

819
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.047
What are you, then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

820
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.799
-A deadly fairy?

821
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.509
Put a spell on the forest, then.

822
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.011
I-I don't cast spells.

823
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:34.638
-Well, what do you do?
-Well, I-I-I judge you.

824
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.142
I sit on your shoulder
and judge your actions

825
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.144
and the quality
of your character.

826
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.812
I'm your conscience.

827
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.314
I really did overpack.

828
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.024
-Whoa!

829
00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.942
Help me, Jack! Help!

830
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.819
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

831
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.362
You're losing a lot of men.

832
00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:52.364
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

833
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:55.993
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

834
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.912
These babies are gonna
get me that wish

835
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.915
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

836
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.999
Now, now, Jack,
as your conscience, I...

837
00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.793
-Oh, my word!

838
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:06.420
It's the noble phoenix.

839
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.089
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...

840
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:10.758
-Oh!

841
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.678
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

842
00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.307
I really have my work
cut out for me on this one.

843
00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:22.353
Don't be near
where I'm flame-throwing.

844
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.737
PUSS:
Do your job, demon flowers.

845
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.364
Soon.

846
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.411
Okay, Kitty,
I think I've got it now.

847
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.540
-Trust me!
-Easy, easy.

848
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.542
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.

849
00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.836
Here, one more time. Like this.

850
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.381
:
Trust me.

851
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.883
Aw. But of course
I trust you and Puss,

852
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.551
even without the eyes.

853
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.553
Yeah? Big mistake.

854
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.264
What do you mean?
You're my friends.

855
00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:00.224
You know what trust gets you?

856
00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:03.352
A sock, a rock
and a swim in the river.

857
00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.145
You have to trust
somebody, right?

858
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.730
Not me. Uh-uh.

859
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.357
Whenever I've let my guard down,

860
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:11.777
I've been double-crossed,
declawed, played and betrayed.

861
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:14.738
Never again.

862
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.198
I am a solo act.

863
00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:19.576
I keep my secrets,
and I play my cards close.

864
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.162
That's how you get
a winning hand.

865
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:23.747
Take it from me.

866
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.291
Never trust anyone.

867
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.421
W-Wait.

868
00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:33.048
That's amazing.

869
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.466
You're good.

870
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.094
Kitty, I've been thinking.

871
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.138
Ugh, thinking about what?

872
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.056
My beautiful beard.

873
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.808
It is very distinguished, yes,

874
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:48.355
but it does deprive the world
a good look at, uh, the face.

875
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:53.319
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...

876
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:54.903
-I've gotten used to it.
-Wait, what?

877
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:56.488
The beard-- keep it.

878
00:51:56.488 --> 00:52:00.200
Uh, well, you see, uh...

879
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.786
Kitty, please,
get this itchy thing off of me!

880
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.747
It's like a fever on my face!

881
00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:09.209
Hold on. Is the great
Puss in Boots asking for help?

882
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.086
Sí, help. You were right.

883
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:13.547
-The beard is disgusting.
-And?

884
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:16.842
And it's like a possum
crawled on my face.

885
00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:17.926
And?

886
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:20.471
And died of shame.

887
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.306
Okay, okay, possum face.

888
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.477
-I won't make you beg.

889
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.813
Ow!

890
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.023
Hey, slow down. Oh!

891
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.232
Go with the grain.

892
00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:34.151
You got to go with the grain.

893
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.652
-I know what I'm doing.
-Hey!

894
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:39.156
I'm a master of the blade.
Right, Perrito?

895
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.241
-What? What? What's funny?

896
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.285
-Nothing should be funny.
-Shh. Quieto.

897
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.546
Ah, there's that handsome face
I remember.

898
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:57.091
The face I haven't seen since...

899
00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:59.259
-Hey!
-...Santa Coloma.

900
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:02.846
Ah, yes. Santa Coloma.

901
00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.598
You had it coming.

902
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.269
Here. You can have
my gatito blade.

903
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.730
Thank you.

904
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.190
Better than a stick.

905
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:18.362
Vaya con Dios, stick sword.

906
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:23.700
-Perro, what are you doing?

907
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.203
Perro.

908
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.454
Where did that crazy dog go?

909
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:29.039
:
I think you like him.

910
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.457
No. No, I don't.

911
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.292
I think
you're ready to name him.

912
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.212
No, I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

913
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.547
You mean my wish.

914
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:38.799
JACK HORNER:
You mean my wish!

915
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.301
Sorry.

916
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.061
-The Baker's Dozen.
-Let him go.

917
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.230
Oh, I don't know.
I might keep him.

918
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.399
Would you like a treat?

919
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.401
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

920
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:59.194
It's not a granny bag.

921
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:01.405
It is a magic nanny bag.

922
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:03.407
Now, make with the map,

923
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:07.244
or we'll see what
the unicorn horn really does.

924
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.166
Y-Y-You're not gonna shoot
a puppy, are you, Jack?

925
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.542
Yeah, in the face. Why?

926
00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:15.419
-What the...

927
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.379
Give us the map, or else

928
00:54:17.379 --> 00:54:18.714
-the baker man gets it.
-Yeah!

929
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:21.884
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo Creep.

930
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:25.012
Stop throwing my men at me!

931
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.306
-Come here!

932
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.599
Puss in Boots has the map!

933
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:31.768
-Let's get him!

934
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:35.439
-I've got a plan.

935
00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:38.233
First one to the dog
gets the wish!

936
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.359
What?

937
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.612
Oh, come on!

938
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.832
Steady.

939
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:56.835
-Whoa!

940
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.130
What?

941
00:55:01.507 --> 00:55:03.258
So that's what they do. Cool.

942
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:05.093
No! Not cool.

943
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.887
Ah, you shot me.

944
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.015
Ah, the sight's off.

945
00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:13.810
-I got him, Mr. Horner!
-My bad.

946
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.978
Oh, no.

947
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:46.260
Puss, wait!

948
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.220
-Perro.

949
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.847
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

950
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.108
-No, no, no!
-No!

951
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:05.195
Oi! You've just been crimed
by the Three Bears Crime Family.

952
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.573
-Yeah!
-So long, you plonkers!

953
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:10.200
!Los voy hacer a todos
alfombras de baño!

954
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.953
Puss, where are you?

955
00:56:23.255 --> 00:56:25.382
Puss? Puss?

956
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:28.635
Puss!

957
00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:34.516
Puss.

958
00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:35.809
:
What's wrong?

959
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:11.178
Thank you, Perrito.

960
00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:13.430
What's going on with you, Puss?

961
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.725
I...

962
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:19.603
I am down to my last life.

963
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.855
And, uh, I...

964
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.524
I am afraid.

965
00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:27.778
Well, it's okay to be afraid.

966
00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:29.988
No, not for Puss in Boots.

967
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:32.866
I-I'm supposed to be
a fearless hero.

968
00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:34.451
A legend.

969
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:39.706
But without lives to spare,
I am nothing.

970
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:42.501
I need that wish
to get my lives back.

971
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:43.752
You should tell Kitty.

972
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.420
-She would understa...
-No, no, no, no.

973
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.172
She cannot hear of this.

974
00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:48.173
Okay.

975
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:50.967
¿Adónde fueron ese idiota
y su perro?

976
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.803
PUSS:
Kitty will never trust me again.

977
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:54.805
Not after Santa Coloma.

978
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:57.057
But that's just one bad heist.

979
00:57:57.057 --> 00:58:00.394
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist,
Perrito.

980
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:05.649
It was a church,
with a priest and guests.

981
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.526
-And Kitty.

982
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:11.029
Everything but me.

983
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:12.989
I ran away then, too.

984
00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.409
Oh. Oh.

985
00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:17.411
Oh!

986
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:20.080
You left her at the altar?

987
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.289
It was wrong. I know.

988
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.625
I am ashamed.

989
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:27.462
I just wish I hadn't
hurt her so badly.

990
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.631
I regret that day.

991
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.843
So, maybe you should
tell that to Kitty.

992
00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:35.721
Might make you feel better.

993
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:38.724
Might make her feel better, too.

994
00:58:40.851 --> 00:58:42.686
Puss! Dog!

995
00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:44.354
Oh, there you are.

996
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.647
What happened back there?

997
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:48.024
Kitty. I lost the map.

998
00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.276
I messed up.

999
00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:50.610
We'll get it back.

1000
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.778
We've been in worse pickles.

1001
00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:53.405
Who told you that name?

1002
00:58:53.405 --> 00:58:54.531
What name?

1003
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.408
Uh, nothing.

1004
00:58:56.408 --> 00:59:01.788
The bears! We have to find them
before they find the star.

1005
00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:05.208
GOLDI:
Oh! We are so close.

1006
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.377
It's finally happening.

1007
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:09.421
I can taste that wish now.

1008
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:11.465
And you know
what it tastes like?

1009
00:59:11.465 --> 00:59:13.258
-Pies?

1010
00:59:19.848 --> 00:59:21.725
-Oh, it's gonna be wicked.

1011
00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:26.062
Yeah. Imagine us,
a big-time crime syndicate.

1012
00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.732
Not a big-time
crime syndicate, love.

1013
00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:31.234
A big-time crime family.

1014
00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.195
Isn't that right, Goldi?

1015
00:59:33.195 --> 00:59:34.237
-Goldi?
-What?

1016
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.491
Whoa! Hey, look,
the map is going all fizzly.

1017
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:38.742
BABY:
What did you do?

1018
00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:40.660
-Give it me. No, no, no, no.
-Hey!

1019
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.413
BABY:
Goldi, no biting!

1020
00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.083
You're the smash, I'm the grab.

1021
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.293
I hold the map.

1022
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.503
-You got it?
-Okay!

1023
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:54.674
"To find your wish,
adjust your view.

1024
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:57.427
What you seek
may be right in front of you."

1025
00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.305
Well, that's a load of rubbish.
What's that supposed to mean?

1026
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.642
BABY:
Right in front of us.

1027
01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.435
It looks like
our cabin back home.

1028
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.728
GOLDI:
You really think our cabin

1029
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.438
is in the middle
of the Dark Forest?

1030
01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.774
Baby, give it
the old sniff test.

1031
01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.109
Something's cooking.

1032
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.278
-No.

1033
01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.863
Do not open that door.

1034
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.449
-We are home! Hello, door.

1035
01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.951
Oh, no, don't go insi...

1036
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.619
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1037
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.038
-Hello, chairs.
-What say we hibernate?

1038
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.456
Hello, honey.

1039
01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.625
Hello, my old friend.

1040
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.378
I have missed you so...

1041
01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.298
Look, Goldi. Porridge.

1042
01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.801
And it's made
just the way you like it.

1043
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.886
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.

1044
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.555
Stop it, all of you.

1045
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.473
Maybe our wishes
have been granted.

1046
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.809
Just stop.
It's not our wish granted.

1047
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.893
It's an obstacle.

1048
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.855
It's the forest playing tricks.

1049
01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.107
This isn't real.
None of this is...

1050
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.120
Aw. That was your favorite book.

1051
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.081
You used to stare at it
for hours.

1052
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.558
Too hard.

1053
01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.059
Whoop!

1054
01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.478
Too soft.

1055
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.986
Just right.

1056
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.655
Oh, this was it.

1057
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:41.948
What was it, Mama?

1058
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.700
The day a little orphan girl

1059
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.703
broke into our cabin
and stole our hearts.

1060
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:54.961
The day when our world
became just right.

1061
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:02.552
How's it going?
Can you see anything up there?

1062
01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.679
Not yet, Perrito...

1063
01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.848
-You okay?
-Sí, I am good.

1064
01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.683
:
So good.

1065
01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.900
If you wanted to hold my hand,
all you had to do is ask.

1066
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.903
Uh, just, uh,
feel free to pull me up

1067
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.780
whenever you get a chance.

1068
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.115
Oh, I was just remembering

1069
01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.743
the last time
I offered you my hand.

1070
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.746
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1071
01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.420
Kitty...

1072
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.259
About that day.

1073
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.429
Puss in Boots is not
supposed to be afraid.

1074
01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.767
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma,

1075
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:56.231
that was the first time
I ever felt fear.

1076
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.150
So I ran.

1077
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.279
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1078
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.656
It's okay.

1079
01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.908
-No, no. It was cowardly.
-It's okay.

1080
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.952
-You alone at the altar.
-Puss.

1081
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.287
In your beautiful,
poofy wedding dress.

1082
01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.040
Puss! It's okay.

1083
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.292
I didn't show up, either.

1084
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.794
Wait, what?

1085
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.963
What do you mean,
you didn't show up?

1086
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.340
Well, I knew
I could never compete

1087
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.300
with your one true love.

1088
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.302
-Who?
-Yourself.

1089
01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.387
The legend.

1090
01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.680
Uh...

1091
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.974
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1092
01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.353
But you don't seem
like that guy anymore.

1093
01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.817
Everything okay up there?

1094
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.944
I'm giving you a thumbs-up,
just so you know.

1095
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.529
KITTY:
Puss!

1096
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.324
Look.

1097
01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.287
What do you think, bug?

1098
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.873
Do I wait for the cats to steal
the map and then kill them,

1099
01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.250
or do I just kill everybody
all at once?

1100
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.335
You know, I'm starting to think

1101
01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.921
you don't appreciate
the value of a life.

1102
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.506
What? No.

1103
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.924
I mean, I love these guys.

1104
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.511
Flex the glutes.
I need a solid surface.

1105
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.057
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.

1106
01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.018
You know, Jack, maybe we need
to dig a little deeper.

1107
01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.479
T-Tell me about your childhood.

1108
01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.357
You know,
I never had much as a kid.

1109
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:25.361
Just loving parents
and stability and a mansion

1110
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.907
and a thriving baked goods
enterprise for me to inherit.

1111
01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.159
Useless crap like that.

1112
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.746
But once I get my wish,

1113
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:38.875
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.

1114
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.086
Oh, well, what's that?

1115
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.296
All of the magic in the world.

1116
01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.006
-For me.

1117
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.050
And no one else gets any.

1118
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.052
-Is that so much?
-Yes!

1119
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.720
Agree to disagree.

1120
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.472
All right, bring it over.

1121
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.939
Help!

1122
01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.858
Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

1123
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.568
Well, you know what they say.

1124
01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.488
Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.

1125
01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.407
-Oh. Oh!

1126
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:12.951
That was horrible.

1127
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.702
Your wish is horrible.

1128
01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:15.870
You're horrible!

1129
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.289
You're an irredeemable monster!

1130
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:21.501
Oh, oh.
What took you so long, idiot?

1131
01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.463
You're not chatty, are you?

1132
01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:26.965
Mm-mm.

1133
01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:31.427
Okay, you take the window,
I'll take the chimney.

1134
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.595
What do I take?

1135
01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.055
Oh, you take it easy, Perrito.

1136
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.890
We need you
to stay here and, uh...

1137
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.600
-Uh, uh, guard our rear.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1138
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.395
On your six. Got your rears
eyeballed and covered.

1139
01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.646
Hands in, crew.

1140
01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:42.856
Ready?

1141
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.732
Go, Team Friendship!

1142
01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.025
Team Friendship?

1143
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.610
I did not agree to this.

1144
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.821
Yeah, do better. Try harder.

1145
01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:50.989
Well, just a placeholder name,
you know.

1146
01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.157
I'll workshop it, okay?

1147
01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.408
-Go get 'em, tiger.
-Hey!

1148
01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.535
-Take it easy.

1149
01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:58.997
Ready to get our wish back?

1150
01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.540
"Our wish"?

1151
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.918
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,

1152
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:07.005
maybe we could share the wish.

1153
01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.383
Share the wish.

1154
01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.028
It's gone!

1155
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.237
-Wake up.

1156
01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.614
Someone's nicked the map.

1157
01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.574
What's all this?
What's all this bother about?

1158
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:35.950
Oi! Did you not hear her?

1159
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.577
The map is missing.

1160
01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:40.330
Somebody took it.

1161
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.497
Hola.

1162
01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.167
Oi! You criming us
when we just crimed you?

1163
01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.835
No, no crime-backs.

1164
01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.837
Oh, you're dead cat meat.

1165
01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.631
-Okay, okay, okay.

1166
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.841
It's all... yours!

1167
01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.135
Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

1168
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.513
Really? Let's see
what the map has to say.

1169
01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.433
-No!

1170
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.602
-Our cabin!
-My honey!

1171
01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.520
What the dickens?

1172
01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.315
Oh, no, you don't.

1173
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.239
Oh, no.

1174
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.081
-We're coming, Gol...
-I'll get it. I'll get it.

1175
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.415
-Get off me, you big lump.
-Hold still.

1176
01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.501
Hold on! I'm coming, Team...

1177
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.921
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry,
sorry, sorry!

1178
01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.341
PUSS:
Uh-oh.

1179
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.718
-Shall we dance? I'll lead.
-Huh? Wha...

1180
01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:38.763
Aah! Too hot!

1181
01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:44.060
Aah! Too cold! Brain freeze.

1182
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.984
-Oh, that is just right.

1183
01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.499
Aye? What the...

1184
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.181
No!

1185
01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:28.062
-Oi! Forget something?

1186
01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.363
They got Perrito!

1187
01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.407
Don't worry,
we can track them with this.

1188
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.744
Wait, stop!

1189
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.667
Puss, watch out!

1190
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.420
Kitty!

1191
01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.671
Puss!

1192
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.593
Look!

1193
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.473
There, there they are.
Just out there.

1194
01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.767
You go get Perrito.
I'll find a way out of here.

1195
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.705
PUSS'S VOICE:
Puss.

1196
01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.505
Hey, good-looking.

1197
01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.964
What is that?

1198
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.175
Why so jumpy, amigo?

1199
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.885
Whoa, what's happening?

1200
01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.929
Hello, Puss. Gazpacho?

1201
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.430
Long time, no see.

1202
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.016
Always a pleasure to see me.

1203
01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.230
It's a proper party now that
all nine of us are here.

1204
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.023
-Yeah! -!Sí! Fiesta!

1205
01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.483
You know what?

1206
01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.235
:
I love you guys.

1207
01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:00.113
So, you are my former lives?

1208
01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.698
Reflections of
the good old days.

1209
01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.367
Okay.

1210
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.035
Back when we were
larger than life.

1211
01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.079
-A legend.
-We dance.

1212
01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:11.499
-We are strong.
-Like the bull.

1213
01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.460
Numero nueve,
you remember this one?

1214
01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:23.886
ALL:

1215
01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:28.349
Well, that's it.
Game over, innit?

1216
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.976
Them cats stole
the stolen map we stole,

1217
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.228
and we ended up with
diddly-squat-- nothing.

1218
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:36.232
Or maybe we could be happy
without a wish.

1219
01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.818
What are we doing?
They ain't coming back.

1220
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.570
Goodbye, purple trousers.

1221
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.072
Oh, they'll come back-- for him.

1222
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.074
You're darn tootin'.

1223
01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.452
Puss and Kitty always rescue me
when I'm kidnapped--

1224
01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.287
which happens a lot--

1225
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.247
'cause we're a team.

1226
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.207
-Aw, that's lovely.
-Yep.

1227
01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.542
Team Friendship.

1228
01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.544
Ugh. No! That is a crap name.

1229
01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.421
Well, we're-we're...
we're still workshopping it.

1230
01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.923
Oh, them cats ain't gonna
risk their lives

1231
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.425
for this daft little pup.

1232
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.552
You're just saying that
because you want to eat 'im.

1233
01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:08.139
I do not. I just want
to pet him with my teeth.

1234
01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.141
Stop thinking about
your belly, Baby.

1235
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.852
In fact, stop thinking, period.

1236
01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.979
You'll just hurt yourself,
you muppet.

1237
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.314
:
"Muppet."

1238
01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:17.815
And why would I listen to

1239
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.693
a porridge-stealing orphan
like you?

1240
01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.820
-You're not even a bear.
-Zing!

1241
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.072
I'm more of a bear
than you are.

1242
01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.949
She got you.

1243
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.660
You're nothing but
a low-rent Cinderella.

1244
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.786
Oh!

1245
01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.246
Well, that's rich
coming from you, Baby,

1246
01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.789
'cause you know what you are?

1247
01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:34.540
Wait for it.

1248
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.209
You're a daft, fat,

1249
01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.503
slow-thinking,
no-reading, Lyme-diseased,

1250
01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.171
flea-ridden dingleberry bear.

1251
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.297
Boom!

1252
01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.007
I haven't got dingleberries.

1253
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.967
No, you do. You do have 'em.

1254
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.135
:
Dingleberries!

1255
01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.553
Oi! You shut up,
you little mutt,

1256
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.472
or I'll cut you
from pooper to snooter!

1257
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.974
I'm in the mix now.

1258
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.893
Okay! Okay, here we go.

1259
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.395
You're all a bunch
of knuckle-dragging,

1260
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.314
honey-scrounging, grub,

1261
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.358
oafish,
munching,

1262
01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.776
mangy nugget,

1263
01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.110
,

1264
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.488
and your snooter!

1265
01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.282
I like the cut of his jib.

1266
01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.034
Ah, this is great.

1267
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:14.664
Razzin' and ribbin' and barbin'
and poopin' and snootin'.

1268
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.251
Oh, I wish I had
a family like this.

1269
01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.419
Speaking from one orphan
to another, Goldi,

1270
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.005
you won the orphan lottery.

1271
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.175
I like his jib as well.

1272
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.094
-Let's keep him.
-What?

1273
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.471
PAPA:
Huh? Where'd he go?

1274
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.057
-No! We said no crime-backs.
-No, Baby, wait!

1275
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.561
Ow! Not the bees!

1276
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.024
-Bravo!

1277
01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.694
One more number.

1278
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.946
:
No, no, sorry, fellas.

1279
01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:48.614
This has been fun, huh?

1280
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.200
Yeah, but could you tell me
how to get out of here?

1281
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.077
I've got to get back
to Dog and Kitty.

1282
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.289
Whoa! I thought you were going
to get the wish.

1283
01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.791
You got the map.
You don't need them.

1284
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.501
Yeah, get those lives back.

1285
01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:04.213
Become the legend again,
town to town.

1286
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.176
-Party to party.

1287
01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:12.054
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1288
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:20.646
Yeah, Puss in Boots walks alone.

1289
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:26.736
Was the legend so big there was
no room for anyone else?

1290
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.575
Oh, the legend's
still big, gato.

1291
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.243
It's you that got small.

1292
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.412
Yeah, you changed, man.

1293
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.456
I hear he's best friends
with a dog now.

1294
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.333
And he doesn't even
have a sword.

1295
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.460
Some hero.

1296
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.587
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1297
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.422
We should call him
Wuss in Boots.

1298
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.757
-Ah, no, no, no, no.

1299
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.259
Didn't you hear?
His new name is Pickles.

1300
01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.927
-So lame.

1301
01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.347
Where is your litter box,
Pickles?

1302
01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.432
You know what?
You guys are jerks.

1303
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.434
Which is very conflicting
for me.

1304
01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.102
I'll find my own way out. Adios.

1305
01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.480
Oh, you think you are
better than us?

1306
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.858
Without us, you will always
live a life of...

1307
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.818
Fear.

1308
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:08.819
You.

1309
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.697
I do love the smell of fear.

1310
01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.616
It's intoxicating.

1311
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.159
It is?

1312
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.537
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives.

1313
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.581
:
Or your past deaths,

1314
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.625
as I like to call them.

1315
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.296
I was there
to witness all of them.

1316
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.841
Each frivolous end.

1317
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:35.221
But you didn't even notice me

1318
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:41.644
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?

1319
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.481
But you're not laughing now.

1320
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.484
You are no bounty hunter.

1321
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.069
You are...

1322
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.488
Death.

1323
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.991
And I don't mean it
metaphorically

1324
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.869
or rhetorically or poetically
or theoretically

1325
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.831
or in any other fancy way.

1326
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.334
I'm Death, straight up.

1327
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.295
And I've come for you,
Puss in Boots.

1328
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.172
But I'm still alive.

1329
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.674
You know...

1330
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.843
I'm not a cat person.

1331
01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:18.848
I find the very idea
of nine lives absurd.

1332
01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.976
And you didn't value
any of them.

1333
01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:25.187
So, why don't I do us
both a favor

1334
01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.606
and take this last one now?

1335
01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.358
That's cheating!

1336
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.026
Shh. Don't tell.

1337
01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.862
Run, Puss in Boots!

1338
01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.572
-Make the wish!

1339
01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.615
Go ahead, run for it.

1340
01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:39.535
Makes it more fun for me.

1341
01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.969
Run.

1342
01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.139
-Run.

1343
01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.184
Hey, Puss.

1344
01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.560
-Run.

1345
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.729
Puss! Puss, we're here!

1346
01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.067
Wh-Where's he going?

1347
01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.008
GOLDI:
That's the third time

1348
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.802
we've passed
that same rock, Baby.

1349
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.262
Oh, not again.

1350
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.555
What do you want me to do?

1351
01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.181
I've lost the scent.

1352
01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.975
You only have one job.

1353
01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:29.144
The one thing that makes you
mildly useful is your nose,

1354
01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.522
and apparently,
you can't even use that.

1355
01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:32.940
-Goldi.
-I'm starting to think

1356
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.650
this wish isn't
what you promised us.

1357
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.111
-Leave off, Baby.
-So, what is it, eh?

1358
01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:40.072
What's your "just right"?
What's so blasted important

1359
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.616
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?

1360
01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.660
I'm getting a family!
That's what.

1361
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.036
A proper family.

1362
01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:49.206
Then everything
will be just right.

1363
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:56.046
Your "just right"
is getting rid of us?

1364
01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:58.716
Well, I guess some people
just stick around

1365
01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:01.760
until the porridge is gone,
eh, Goldi?

1366
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.140
Come on.

1367
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.435
You didn't think
I would actually stay.

1368
01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:11.103
I'm not a bear.

1369
01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.990
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.

1370
01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.868
And whether you think
we're your family or not,

1371
01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:29.538
if this is something
that will make you happy,

1372
01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.624
we'll get you that wish.

1373
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.876
Come on, boys.

1374
01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:45.054
:
Oh, what a good boy am I.

1375
01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:56.023
"Star light, star bright,

1376
01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.734
"first star I see tonight,

1377
01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.985
I wish..."

1378
01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.403
I can't believe
I fell for it again.

1379
01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.405
Kitty, you don't understand.

1380
01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.240
Don't understand what?

1381
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.743
That you've been playing me
this whole time?

1382
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.328
I need this wish.

1383
01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.289
Oh, yeah? You want to know
what my wish was?

1384
01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.001
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1385
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.294
Hey!

1386
01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:20.130
In my whole life,
I've never had that.

1387
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.550
But I thought I finally found
that someone

1388
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.970
without a wish.

1389
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.930
I thought it was you.

1390
01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.849
But you're still running.

1391
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.686
Still the same old
Puss in Boots.

1392
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.188
But I am not!
I am not Puss in Boots.

1393
01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.773
I'm...

1394
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.566
I am on my last life.

1395
01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:42.152
I need to get my lives back.

1396
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:45.531
Without them, I am not...
I-I am not...

1397
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.074
What? The legend?

1398
01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:53.914
I still can't compete
with your one true love.

1399
01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:56.250
Go on, get your lives back.

1400
01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:00.004
Just keep them out of mine.

1401
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.677
Kitty, Death is after me!

1402
01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.220
What?

1403
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.305
I've been called
a lot of things...

1404
01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.807
but never Death.

1405
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.142
I like it.

1406
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.477
-That's my wish!
-Oi!

1407
01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.480
That's Goldi's wish.

1408
01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.018
PAPA:
Grab him!

1409
01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:58.854
JACK HORNER:
Move! Out of my way!

1410
01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.814
I've got it! I've got it!
Don't got it.

1411
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.193
JACK HORNER:
That's mine.

1412
01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:11.867
Bang, bang, bang!

1413
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.330
Oh, come on.
You walked into that one.

1414
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.459
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1415
01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:23.337
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment.

1416
01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.546
Pew, pew!

1417
01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.257
Mr. Horner!

1418
01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.557
-Ooh.

1419
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.268
Aha! It's bear season.

1420
01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.730
Oi, I'm gonna bust you up,
plum thumb,

1421
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.816
and then I'm gonna
wear your clothes.

1422
01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.234
That was weird.

1423
01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.238
-No, no, no...

1424
01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.197
Baby!

1425
01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:51.907
-Mama, help!
-I got you!

1426
01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.867
-Papa!
-Son, I'm coming!

1427
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:55.494
-Got you.
-Help!

1428
01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.955
-Hold on!
-Something's happening!

1429
01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.331
Help me!

1430
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.585
Help! No, no, no!

1431
01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.420
Hang on, son!

1432
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.840
I can't stop it!

1433
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.174
Mama, I'm slipping!

1434
01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.677
I'm slipping...

1435
01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:19.351
Like I told you, Baby,
you're the smash, I'm the grab.

1436
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.520
Yes! Yes!

1437
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.983
-No!

1438
01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:34.950
Hey, Softpaws,
how do you like these apples?

1439
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.245
Die! Blow up already.

1440
01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.998
-Softpaws.

1441
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.792
Okay.

1442
01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:48.297
Okay, you know, maybe it's time
to bury the hatchet!

1443
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.302
Oh, I shouldn't have
telegraphed it!

1444
01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.897
Yeah, I don't know
what to do with this,

1445
01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:07.816
but if you think
you need those lives...

1446
01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.027
Thank you, Perrito.

1447
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.447
You know,
I've only ever had one life,

1448
01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:16.408
but sharing it
with you and Kitty

1449
01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:18.577
has made it pretty special.

1450
01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:21.997
Maybe one life is enough.

1451
01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.174
-Huh?
-What is that?

1452
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.556
Who's that?

1453
01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.018
He's here for me.

1454
01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:50.442
Puss!

1455
01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.115
I've enjoyed the chase, gato,

1456
01:23:57.115 --> 01:24:00.035
but I think we've reached
the end now, you and I.

1457
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.206
You gonna take
the coward's way out?

1458
01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:07.084
Run away to more lives?

1459
01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.378
Or are you gonna fight?

1460
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.718
Pick it up.

1461
01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.388
Go on, pick it up.

1462
01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.282
WOLF:
What's the matter?

1463
01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.993
Lives flashing before your eyes?

1464
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.786
No.

1465
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:44.246
Just one.

1466
01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.206
I'm done running.

1467
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:53.213
Fear me, if you dare.

1468
01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:57.092
This is gonna be fun.

1469
01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.155
Bien.

1470
01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.198
Muy bien.

1471
01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.594
You really got to stop
losing that.

1472
01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:57.152
Say hello to my gatito blade.

1473
01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:02.991
Come on!

1474
01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.554
Pick it up.

1475
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.809
I know I can never
defeat you, lobo,

1476
01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:32.479
but I will never stop fighting
for this life.

1477
01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:57.045
¿Por qué diablos fui a jugar
con mi comida?

1478
01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.881
You're ruining this for me.

1479
01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:03.552
I came here for
an arrogant little legend

1480
01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.887
who thought he was immortal.

1481
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:10.225
But I don't see him anymore.

1482
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.857
Live your life, Puss in Boots.

1483
01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.358
Live it well.

1484
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.906
You know we will
meet again, right?

1485
01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.826
Sí. Hasta la muerte.

1486
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.298
-You know,

1487
01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.300
when you said
Death was after you,

1488
01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.344
I thought you were just
being melodramatic.

1489
01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:48.430
The wish is yours.

1490
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.683
You deserve someone
you can trust.

1491
01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:57.647
I don't need it.

1492
01:27:57.647 --> 01:27:59.483
I've got what I wished for.

1493
01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:01.526
No magic required.

1494
01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:15.165
JACK HORNER:
Ah, magic snacks.

1495
01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.839
Holy frijoles.

1496
01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.509
I was worried for a second
I would come out naked,

1497
01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.970
but my clothes grew, too. Cool.

1498
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.014
Thank you.

1499
01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.142
Gotcha.

1500
01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.311
The last wish.

1501
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.647
It's mine.

1502
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.566
"Star light, star bright,

1503
01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:43.860
-first star I see tonight..."

1504
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.487
PUSS:
Perrito!

1505
01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.657
"I wish I may, I wish I might

1506
01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:51.743
-have this wish..." Huh?
-Señor Horner!

1507
01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.704
Please don't make that wish.
Please?

1508
01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.165
:
Please?

1509
01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.333
Wh-What are you doing?

1510
01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.502
:
Please...

1511
01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:02.546
Seriously, are you having
a hernia or something?

1512
01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:06.675
:
Pretty please...

1513
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.555
They're such pools
of vulnerability.

1514
01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.517
It's so cute...

1515
01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.061
how you think
that would work on me.

1516
01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:19.688
Don't you know I'm dead inside?

1517
01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:21.940
By the way,
your nose is bleeding.

1518
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.400
Oh.

1519
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.070
I was just buying some time
for Team Friendship.

1520
01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.948
Team what?

1521
01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.917
BOTH:
Spanish Splinter!

1522
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:43.587
Ow!

1523
01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:47.882
Hey!

1524
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.557
What have you done? No!

1525
01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.392
The map. My wish.

1526
01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.643
MAMA:
Go, go, go!

1527
01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:01.730
Whoa!

1528
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.149
It's mine.

1529
01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:06.818
Huh?

1530
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.862
:
You looking for something?

1531
01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.740
Consider this
my resignation, mister.

1532
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:15.827
What?

1533
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:19.581
What did I do to deserve this?

1534
01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.752
I mean, what specifically...?

1535
01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.680
MAMA:
Gorgeous.

1536
01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:40.810
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?

1537
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:44.648
Kitty, one life spent with you

1538
01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:46.941
is all that I could wish for.

1539
01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:59.829
BABY :
You saved my life, sis.

1540
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.831
You was gonna make the wish,
but you didn't make the wish

1541
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.458
'cause you wanted
to save your family.

1542
01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.251
-And I-I was really scared.

1543
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.586
And then...

1544
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.463
Oi, don't get
so blubbery about it.

1545
01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.131
Whose porridge would I eat
otherwise?

1546
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.218
I'm sorry you didn't get
your wish, Goldi, love.

1547
01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.386
But I did, Mama.

1548
01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.346
I did get my wish.

1549
01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.306
Everything...

1550
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.975
is just right.

1551
01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.143
Oh.

1552
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.812
Oh, now you've made me cry.

1553
01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:25.105
Aw.

1554
01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.774
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?

1555
01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:30.694
Hey, Goldi, you are a chip
off the old block, you are.

1556
01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.196
Well, what can I say?

1557
01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.240
I won the orphan lottery.

1558
01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.076
Softpaws, Boots.

1559
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.494
-Goldi.
-Bears.

1560
01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.580
Hey, Baby, you got any ideas
for our next job?

1561
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.416
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1562
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.459
I suspect that
they might be experiencing

1563
01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.961
a leadership vacuum.

1564
01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:49.671
:
Oh, family business.

1565
01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.339
Oh, how exciting.

1566
01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:55.051
Now's a good time to talk about
ethical business practices.

1567
01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.846
There's a talking
cockroach on my nose!

1568
01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.764
-Get it off! Get off!
-Hold still.

1569
01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.516
BUG:
Oh, no, no, wait just a second.

1570
01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.727
-Ow! Hey! Hang on!

1571
01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.603
Hey, Perrito, about that name.

1572
01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:07.188
Let's pick one out for you.

1573
01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.566
Yeah. Oh, what about "Chiquito"?

1574
01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.192
-Hmm...
-Ah. "Chomper."

1575
01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.485
What do you think, Perrito?

1576
01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:13.695
"Chomper," no?

1577
01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.155
I got it, I got it.

1578
01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:16.990
How about "Jeff"?

1579
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.491
-Jeff?
-Yeah.

1580
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.034
He doesn't have a Jeff's face.

1581
01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.704
You know,
if it's the same to you,

1582
01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:24.706
I think I'll just stick
with "Perrito."

1583
01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:26.374
I kind of like it,

1584
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.251
since that's what
my friends call me.

1585
01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:31.713
-Then "Perrito" it shall be.

1586
01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.883
You know, to be honest,
"Chomper" is pretty good.

1587
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.551
PERRITO:
Yeah, but no.

1588
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.636
Well, we'll keep,
uh, workshopping it.

1589
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:54.569
I want this vacation
to be perfect!

1590
01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:56.863
Did you remember to pack
my captain's hat?

1591
01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.573
-Yes, Governor.

1592
01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.366
And your captain's shoes,
your captain's coat

1593
01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:01.743
and your captain's pajamas.

1594
01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:03.578
And what about...

1595
01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.580
My boat!

1596
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.749
Puss in Boots!

1597
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.131
PUSS:
Perrito!

1598
01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:16.424
Team Friendship?

1599
01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.884
We did not agree to this.

1600
01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:20.428
Yeah, it makes us
look ridiculous.

1601
01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.763
Too late now. It's official.

1602
01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:23.598
-Aah! Seagull! Whoa.

1603
01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:28.102
Steady as she goes, Perrito.

1604
01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.437
Dokey doke.

1605
01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:30.939
Where are we headed, anyways?

1606
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.775
Off to find new adventures

1607
01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:37.362
and to see some old friends.

1608
01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:23.361
-Welcome to my fiesta!

1609
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.952
Puss in Boots!

1610
01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:35.039
To more, a hero.

1611
01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:38.209
To all, a legend.

1612
01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:43.131
-Uh-huh!

1613
01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.915
Puss in Boots!

1614
01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.339
Puss in Boots!

1615
01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:42.023
Puss in Boots!

1616
01:37:53.034 --> 01:37:54.786
I love that song.

1617
01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:57.371
Bravo!

1618
01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:47.421
Puss in Boots!

1619
01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:15.671
PUSS:
Oh, you're still here?
